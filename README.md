# Tic-Tac-Game
Create a classic tic-tac-toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide interactive gaming experience. Players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, aiming to achieve a row, column, or diagonal of their symbol (either "X" or "O") to win. The game employs event listeners to handle player clicks and give new game button and reset button.
