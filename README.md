# Tic-Tac-Game
 Create a classic tic-tac-toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an engaging and interactive gaming experience. Players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, aiming to achieve a row, column, or diagonal of their symbol (either "X" or "O") to win. The game employs event listeners to handle player clicks, dynamically updates the grid display, and includes logic to determine the winner or a draw.
